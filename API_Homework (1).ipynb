Then, as often happens, investors faded the first move, stocks were lower into the close, and currently the futures market is through the roof. End of day, the Fed's target is now 4.75%-5.25%. By the last 2024 meeting on December 18, there is a 50% probability that the funds range will be 4.00%-4.25% and a 32% chance the target will be 4.25%-4.50%. Treasury yields across the curve ticked higher, mostly in the five- and 10-year yields, which rose 30 to 40 bps. Market yields have been falling since April in anticipation of a slowing economy and the rate.   We are now in the last half of September, and the next two weeks historically are the worst of the year for stocks. Did we front-load those losses during the first four trading days of the month or does the market have pain ahead? Short term, it's hard to get a good feel for what will play out. But we feel confident that the fourth quarter will be kind to investors. The last quarter of the year, especially the months of November and December, are typically two of the strongest months of the year.   The other nagging question (and keeping in mind that there are multiple economic reports ahead, 3Q EPS reports in October, and a presidential election in November) is the following. What will lead the market into the end of the year? Over the past three months, leadership has come from Real Estate, Utilities, Financial, Consumer Staples, Industrials, Healthcare, and Consumer Discretionary. That is a broad group. Information Technology is the only sector that has been down over the past three months.

The Nasdaq and the Nasdaq 100 were dragged down from the start due to a tough day for semiconductors. The iShares Semiconductor ETF (SOXX) fell 2.5% and is sitting on short-term support from its 10- and 21-day exponential moving averages. The SOXX has had a nice recovery since the August 5 intraday low -- and with Nvidia reporting after Wednesday's close, it's not surprising that some anxiety is building in front of the numbers. Discretionary also fell due to weakness in Tesla.  Energy led the 11 S&P 500 sectors, as crude oil (WTI) bounced for a third day. Crude is back up to $77/barrel from a low last week of $71.46. The oil chart is a mess, with prices chopping around from the low $60s to the mid-$90s since the summer of 2022. Other sector strength was seen from the defensive Staples and Utilities groups, with minor gains in Materials, Financials, and Communication Services.   A fair amount of people in the financial world have said that the S&P 500's almost full recovery from the pullback in the second half of July into early August has been too fast. But quick recoveries and \\\"V\\\" bottoms generally are quite bullish and often lead to additional all-time highs. On the weekly charts, we had quick recoveries in the latter part of 2023 and in April/May of this year. And let's not forget the recovery from the pandemic, the recovery in early 2019, the recovery in 2014, and the several recoveries in 2012.

We review 13Fs of major institutional investors, including activists, to see what they are buying and to look for trends. Activist investing is now less about generating a short-term return and more about achieving long-term returns through an active management/investor partnership. The stock-market volatility during 2Q gave those institutional investors a chance to buy a dip. Taking a look at the 13Fs from well-known institutional portfolios, we see that the big guns were busy, either adding new holdings or increasing existing holdings. Buying was across a variety of sectors. Based on Vickers data, the following are select purchases made in 2Q by some high-profile money managers.

The Unemployment Rate ticked up to 4.3% for July from 4.1% the month before. Nonfarm Payrolls printed at 114,000, much lower than the expected and the month before. These weak labor numbers raise questions: Did the Fed wait too long before pivoting to easing monetary policy? Will they enact a larger cut in September, perhaps 50 bps instead of the expected 25 bps? Is the desired soft landing still possible?

After three down days, that was enough for the \\\"king of the hill\\\" and investors swooped in and catapulted Nvidia (NVDA) to a 6.7% pop on June 25. The stock is now just 7% from its recent all-time closing high. While other semiconductor stocks rose as well, their gains were muted -- with most of the heavyweights gaining 2%-3%. ARM Holdings Plc (ARM) was the exception, reclaiming 6.4%.   So was that it for the great semiconductor decline in 2024? Bullishly, most of the big stocks held initial support from their 21-day exponential averages. In addition, the semis quickly worked off extreme momentum divergences on a daily basis. But many remain overbought on a weekly basis and have traced out weekly bearish divergences (some quite glaring). From a technical basis, we would prefer (and lean toward) more sideways-to-down price action in the coming weeks before the next leg higher. Seasonally, the summer-to-fall period has been the worst for semiconductors and technology in general.     As for the areas of the market that had benefited recently, June 25 was not a pretty day. The S&P MidCap 400 declined 1%, while the S&P SmallCap 600 fell 0.9%. Looking at sectors, Real Estate (XLRE), Materials (XLB), and Utilities (XLU) all dropped at least 1%, with Financials (XLF) and Industrials (XLI) giving back 0.8%.

He doubled down in his January 2021 letter, calling on company managements to disclose their plans for making their businesses \\\"compatible with a net-zero economy\\\" by 2050. As assets have flowed in over the past 40 years, Sustainable Impact Investing has evolved. The discipline, originally known as Socially Responsible Investing, focused at first on excluding companies that conducted business in South Africa, or participated in industries such as tobacco, alcohol, and firearms. Performance of these initial strategies lagged, and the approach has been modified. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \\\"sustainable\\\" business practices across all industries that can have an \\\"impact\\\" on global issues such as climate, hunger, poverty, disease, shelter, and workers' rights.\"},{\"id\":\"39967_Technical Analysis_1715338854000\",\"title\":\"Technical Assessment: Bullish in the Intermediate-Term\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2024-05-10T11:00:54Z\",\"summary\":\"In the metals space, the iShares Silver Trust ETF (SLV) looks interesting, at least from a short-term technical perspective.

Alphabet lost a steep 10% in one day last week after investors expressed their disappointment over growth in its cloud business. That same day, Microsoft surged after reporting better-than-expected growth in its Azure OpenAI cloud service. The race is on, and some will win and some will lose along the way. But the potential pie is big. In the internet era, in which digital commerce complements or has supplanted physical commerce, the information technology needs of all enterprises have grown. The traditional on-premises approach has been rendered inefficient, given that a user's IT needs may fluctuate at any time. Into this void, the Cloud has arrived. In Cloud services models, an enterprise's IT needs can be matched and scaled in real time. Through the Cloud, enterprises consume only as much computing, storage, and networking bandwidth as they need. For a major event, this allows massive scaling of IT resources beyond the restraints of on-premises implementation. For periods in which operations are steady, the Cloud services model allows for a needs-only application. The leading providers of Cloud services tend to be large Technology and Communication Services companies that provide many goods and services distinct from or adjacent to their Cloud businesses. Growth has been impressive for this group. Collectively, participants in the Cloud eco-system grew revenue at a 19% compound annual growth rate from 2016 to 2022. Still, the line isn't straight up.  While Cloud services grew at a 23% growth rate from 2020 to 2021, the average growth rate slowed to 15.3% for 2022.  This slowdown in revenue growth reflected impediments to normal business activity from the supply-chain crisis, inflation, and rising interest rates. Even so, demand for Cloud services has held up relatively well, given that Cloud transition is a long-tailed process and that Cloud transformation has become an imperative. Here is a list of U.S.-based companies followed by Argus and that we think are in position to take advantage of this secular trend.\"},{\"id\":\"38102_Thematic Portfolio_1698327961000\",\"title\":\"The Argus Innovation Model Portfolio\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2023-10-26T13:46:01Z\",\"summary\":\"Innovation may be hard to define.

Last month, in its second estimate, the government indicated that 2Q GDP rose at an annualized 2.1% pace, up slightly from the 2.0% growth rate in 1Q23. We think that rate will hold steady, though we note that any surprise is likely to occur on the upside. As is typically the case, the report will indicate areas of strength and weakness in the economy.  On the positive side, the consumer appears to be in good shape, with Personal Consumption Expenditures expanding at a 1%-2% pace, driven by spending on Services. Companies continue to invest in R&D projects and software, as Investments into Intellectual Property are advancing at a rate that is faster than overall GDP growth. Government spending has picked up as well during the past year. On the downside, Residential Investment has weakened as interest rates have risen, though the sector seems to be bottoming; and Exports of Goods have been challenged by the strong dollar.

Argus has derived a model of the size and scope of the global AI industry, based on our coverage of the major publicly-traded players and most of the mid-tier players, along with our industry analysts' knowledge of private players. We estimate the global AI industry amounted to about $90-$100 billion in 2021, and expect it to grow at a 40% CAGR through 2030, when it is expected to reach $1.8 trillion in annual revenue. We expect annual growth to decelerate from the low- to mid-40% range in immediate years to the mid-30% range for years toward the end of the survey period. But determining a realistic estimate for the size of the industry is a challenge. Even for an industry that promises to redefine measuring tools, there is no measurable unit of AI output comparable to barrels of oil or tons of steel. As well, much of AI development occurs within labs and at universities, and the output is measured in tangible progress against objectives, not dollars or units of output. In the corporate world, nearly all the AI pure-play companies service micro-niches, have little measurable revenue, and are deeply unprofitable. For our list this week, we take a big picture view of three areas where AI applications are developing. In Big Tech, we believe much of the revenue and most of the profitability from AI is attributable to several giant U.S. and a few international companies that operate primarily in growth sectors such as Technology, Communication Services, and Consumer Discretionary. Next, we note that China is also a hub of AI development, with companies like Alibaba, Baidu, and Tencent (though Argus follows only Alibaba). Finally, Niche Tech has significant AI activity among companies pursuing advances in IoT, vehicle electrification, autonomous driving, automation and connectivity solutions for manufacturing, warehousing, construction, and other areas. Here are featured companies followed by Argus in those three categories.\"},{\"id\":\"2660_Analyst Report_1694623467000\",\"title\":\"Analyst Report: Apple Inc\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2023-09-13T16:44:27Z\",\"summary\":\"Apple manufactures smartphones, tablets, PCs, software and peripherals for a worldwide customer base.

While the absolute number of jobs gained was well under expectations, some economists believe the seasonal adjustment (related to limited return to classrooms in fall 2020) may have skewed the data, and that without adjustments the job tally would have been higher.\"},{\"id\":\"31026_Market Outlook_1632994423000\",\"title\":\"Daily Spotlight: Final 2Q GDP Reading: +6.7%\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2021-09-30T09:33:43Z\",\"summary\":\"The U.S. Department of Commerce announced that its third estimate for 2Q21 GDP growth was a rate of 6.7%. This was in line with the previous estimates and with the consensus outlook, and represents a robust recovery. The GDP report also includes an inflation gauge, the PCE price index.  This index, excluding food and energy, rose at a 6.1% pace, well ahead the Federal Reserve's inflation target of 2.0%, though the Fed has said that it will allow inflation to run hot for a while before raising short-term interest rates. Looking ahead, we expect above-trend GDP growth for the next few quarters. But there may be bumps along the way, including the impact of the delta variant on jobs and consumer spending on services, as well as supply-chain bottlenecks. Speaking of the employment environment, unemployment claims rose last week to 362,000, according to the Labor Department. This was the third consecutive week of rising claims. The four-week average of continued claims (the chronically unemployed) was 2.8 million, flat week-to-week and down from the pandemic highs of more than 20 million in May 2020 (but still substantially higher than the 1.7 million reading in February 2020, before the pandemic struck).\"},{\"id\":\"2660_Analyst Report_1631690019000\",\"title\":\"Analyst Report: Apple Inc\",\"provider\":\"Argus Research\",\"publishedOn\":\"2021-09-15T07:13:39Z\",\"summary\":\"Apple manufactures smartphones, tablets, PCs, software and peripherals for a worldwide customer base.

But the sector has come on strong in recent months (up 22% year-to-date) and now is outperforming the market (up 20.7%) as well as value sectors such as Consumer Staples (+8%), Utilities (+10%), Materials (+17%), and Industrials (+18%). The sector is the largest in the U.S. market and now accounts for more than 28% of the S&P 500. Over the long term, we expect the sector to benefit from pervasive digitization across the economy, greater acceptance of transformative technologies, and the development of the Internet of Things (IoT). Healthy company and sector fundamentals are also positive. For individual companies, these include high cash levels, low debt, and broad international business exposure.

According to Opimas, a management consultancy focused on global capital markets, global assets under management in ESG strategies grew to $40.5 trillion in 2020, doubling in four years and tripling in eight. As assets have flowed in, SRI investing has evolved over the past 40 years. Now, instead of merely identifying industries to avoid, the discipline promotes \\\"sustainable\\\" business practices across all businesses that can have an \\\"impact\\\" on global issues such as workers' rights, poverty, hunger, and the climate. Based on numerous requests from clients, we have compiled a portfolio of companies followed by Argus Research that are in position to have this type of \\\"sustainable impact\\\" on the environment, workplace, and community. These firms have exemplary records not only in delivering on the bottom line, but also in improving the environment, contributing to community relations, and showing respect for their employees. We built our portfolio by identifying companies that are BUY-rated by Argus analysts and also score well on ESG (Environmental, Social and Governance) criteria established by the JUST Capital Foundation. JUST Capital utilizes a combination of polling, data-driven research, and strategic engagement to shift behaviors and activities in corporate America and the financial markets. JUST Capital's mission is to drive measurable corporate change to create a stakeholder-centric, inclusive form of capitalism that reflects the priorities of the American public.
